## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add a delete control to each task item (read-only view) with accessible label and confirm no impact on edit form layout.
- [x] 1.2 Implement task removal from in-memory list and LocalStorage, clearing any active edit state or errors tied to the deleted task.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure filtered views update immediately after deletion (including when a filter is active) and preserve the empty-list message behavior.
- [x] 1.4 Validate create/edit/complete/filter flows still work after deletes, including persistence across reloads.
