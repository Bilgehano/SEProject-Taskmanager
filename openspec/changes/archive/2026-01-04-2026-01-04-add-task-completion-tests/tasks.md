# Tasks for Add Task Completion Tests

1. Review the current implementation of the task completion feature.
2. Identify all scenarios that need to be tested (e.g., toggling, persistence, multiple tasks).
3. Write automated tests for each scenario.
4. Run the tests and verify they pass.
5. Ensure no regressions in existing functionality (e.g., task creation, editing).
6. Document the test results and update the spec if necessary.
