## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add UI affordance (e.g., Edit button) for each task item and track which task is being edited.
- [x] 1.2 Prefill the task form with the selected task's title, description, and due date while in edit mode and provide a way to cancel edits.
- [x] 1.3 Update the submit handler to apply changes to the existing task, persist to LocalStorage, and re-render the list without duplicating entries.
- [x] 1.4 Adjust button labels and messaging so users know whether they are adding or editing a task.

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Manually verify that edits survive a browser refresh and that validation errors prevent invalid updates.
