# Tasks for Add Task Completion

1. Update the task model to include a `completed` boolean property (default: false).
2. Update task creation logic to set `completed` to false by default.
3. Update task rendering to show completed/open state and provide a toggle control (e.g., checkbox or button).
4. Implement toggle logic to change a task's completed state in memory.
5. Persist completed state changes to LocalStorage.
6. Load completed state from LocalStorage on app initialization.
7. Add/Update tests or validation steps to confirm correct behavior.
